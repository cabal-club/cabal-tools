## `cycle-cabal.sh`

`cycle-cabal.sh` by cblgh, generates a new cabal key and updates the cabal-club website repo

### Usage

* `npm install`
* `chmod +x cycle-cabal.sh`
* `./cycle-cabal.sh directory/to/cabal-club.github.io/ (optional cabal key)`
    * _if the optional cabal key is omitted, a new one is generated_

Note: it currently **also pushes** to the repo for cabal-club.github.io (_should it?_)
